# Timber Ruby / Rails Example App

This application demonstrates how Timber is installed and capture context in your typical rails app. A few things to note:

1. Devise was installed to demonstrate user context.
2. Omniauth was also installed to show that it works with multiple authentication schemes.
3. A `/products` CRUD controller was added to demonstrate SQL queries and the like.
4. An `/exception` endpoint was added to demonstrate exceptions.
